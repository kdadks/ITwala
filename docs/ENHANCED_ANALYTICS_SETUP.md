# Enhanced Analytics System - Complete Setup

## 🎉 What's New

Your analytics system now includes:
- **📊 Interactive Charts** - Visual representation of page views over time
- **📱 Real-time Top Pages** - Shows actual pages being viewed with titles and URLs
- **🌐 Traffic Sources** - See where your visitors are coming from
- **💻 Device Breakdown** - Desktop, mobile, tablet usage statistics
- **🚀 Live Data** - No more mock data, shows real website usage

## Step 1: Clear Mock Data (Important!)

First, run this SQL to remove the sample/mock data and start with real tracking:

```sql
-- Copy and paste this into your Supabase SQL Editor:
-- File: clear-mock-analytics-data.sql

DELETE FROM analytics_data;
TRUNCATE TABLE analytics_data RESTART IDENTITY;

INSERT INTO analytics_data (
    date, page_views, unique_visitors, total_time, bounce_rate,
    top_pages, referrers, devices
) VALUES (
    CURRENT_DATE, 0, 0, 0, 0.00,
    '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb, '[]'::jsonb
) ON CONFLICT (date) DO NOTHING;
```

## Step 2: Test Real-Time Tracking

1. **Clear your browser cache** to ensure the analytics tracker loads fresh
2. **Navigate around your website**:
   - Visit the homepage
   - Go to different course pages
   - Browse other sections
   - Spend some time on each page

3. **Check the Analytics page**:
   - Go to Admin Dashboard → Analytics
   - You should see real page views appearing in "Top Pages (Real-time)"
   - Page titles and URLs will show actual pages you visited

## Step 3: Generate Analytics Data

To populate the daily analytics summary:

```bash
# Run this script to aggregate today's data
cd scripts && node run-analytics-aggregation.js
```
