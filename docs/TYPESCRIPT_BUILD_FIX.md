# TypeScript Build Fix for Netlify Deployment

## Problem
The Netlify build was failing with the following error:
```
It looks like you're trying to use TypeScript but do not have the required package(s) installed.
Please install typescript by running:
	yarn add --dev typescript
```

This occurred despite TypeScript being properly configured and working locally.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by dependency resolution problems in Netlify's build environment. While TypeScript was listed in `devDependencies`, some cloud build environments have issues with dependency installation order and resolution, particularly when dependencies are only in `devDependencies`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Moved TypeScript to Dependencies
- Moved `typescript` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` in [`package.json`](../package.json:1)
- This ensures TypeScript is available during the build process regardless of the environment's dependency installation strategy

### 2. Reorganized Type Definitions
- Moved `@types/next` and `@types/nodemailer` to `devDependencies` where they belong
- Kept all other `@types/*` packages in `devDependencies` as they're only needed during development

### 3. Added Node.js Engine Specification
- Added `engines` field to specify minimum Node.js and npm versions
- This helps ensure consistent behavior across different deployment environments

## Changes Made

### Before:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // ... other dependencies
    "@types/next": "^8.0.7",
    "@types/nodemailer": "^6.4.17",
    // ... other dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // ... other devDependencies
    "typescript": "^5.8.3"
  }
}
```

### After:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // ... other dependencies
    "typescript": "^5.8.3"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    // ... other devDependencies
    "@types/next": "^8.0.7",
    "@types/nodemailer": "^6.4.17",
    // ... other devDependencies
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=18.0.0",
    "npm": ">=8.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Verification
- ✅ Local build continues to work: `npm run build`
- ✅ Dependencies install correctly: `npm install`
- ✅ TypeScript compilation works properly
- ✅ Next.js build process completes successfully

## Future Deployment Notes

### For Netlify Deployments:
1. Ensure TypeScript remains in `dependencies` (not just `devDependencies`)
2. The build command should remain `npm run build`
3. Node.js version should be >= 18.0.0

### For Other Cloud Providers:
- This fix should resolve similar issues on other cloud deployment platforms (Vercel, Railway, etc.)
- If issues persist, verify that the build environment is installing all dependencies from both `dependencies` and `devDependencies`

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Dependency Availability**: Moving TypeScript to `dependencies` ensures it's installed in all environments, regardless of whether they run `npm install --production` or `npm install`

2. **Build Process Reliability**: TypeScript is required during the build process, not just development, so it belongs in `dependencies`

3. **Environment Consistency**: The `engines` field helps ensure the deployment environment uses compatible Node.js and npm versions

## Testing the Fix

To test this fix in your deployment:

1. Push the updated `package.json` to your repository
2. Trigger a new Netlify build
3. The build should now complete successfully without TypeScript errors

## Build Process Verification

The successful build output should show:
```
✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Compiled successfully
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages
✓ Finalizing page optimization
```

Without any TypeScript-related errors.
